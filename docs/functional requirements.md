1. **INTRODUCTION**

**1.1 Purpose**
The purpose of this document is to define what features should the Watering Schedule contain as described in the project brief.

1. **business requirements overview**
The key feature of this app is to make it easier for the user to add data (name of plant, instructions for watering, photo of plant...) to the scheduler. It also has to be readable and easy to use. Because it is a private app, it should be password-protected.


**2.1 Assumptions and Constraints**
Although the artist does not wish to have analytics at this time, I think that some of them would be useful. So a database to store information is a must.

There will probably be a limit to the size of images uploaded at some point.

1. **functional requirements and user impacts**
The app has to be user-friendly. It has to have an easy way to:
- add new plant:
	- take a higher-resolution picture
	- choose the type of watering from a predefined list (dropdown menu?)
	- an easy way of adding instructions
	- when to water (no. of days)
	- choose a location from a predefined list (dropdown menu?)
	- add a specialty requirement for the plant (as an icon?)
- edit an existing plant
- archive/delete existing plant
- adding / editing list of locations, watering types
- add a comment to plant
- checkbox for plants that have been watered
- see all plants in a list
- ?? alert for watering, checking in

It has to have a database to keep the data. I suspect further data analytic features will be added in the future.

**3.1 Usability Requirements**
The app has to be low maintenance for the use and easy to use. It has to have some degree of design, but form follows function. It should be very clear and intuitive for the user.

It should be designed in a way to be able to add on new features that arise with use.


**3.2 Performance Requirements**
TBD


**3.3 Supportability Requirements**
TBD


**3.4 Security Requirements**
Since it is a CRM app, we will have a username + password to log in.
It will have a signup with Google login for users to just read the data if the artist allows.


**3.5 Interface Requirements**
It has to be easily accessible, with as few clicks (taps) as possible, but still be very clear.  The main screen will be an iPad but could be used on a phone or laptop if desired.

**3.6 Assumptions / Constraints**
TBD

1. **Compliance requirements**
NA

**4.1 Assumptions / Constraints**
